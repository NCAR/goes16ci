error: can't create or remove files in install directory

The following error occurred while trying to add or remove files in the
installation directory:

    [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/gpfs/u/apps/dav/opt/python/3.6.8/gnu/7.3.0/pkg-library/20190723/lib/python3.6/site-packages/test-easy-install-44963.write-test'

The installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or
the distutils default setting) was:

    /gpfs/u/apps/dav/opt/python/3.6.8/gnu/7.3.0/pkg-library/20190723/lib/python3.6/site-packages/

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  If the
installation directory is a system-owned directory, you may need to sign in
as the administrator or "root" account.  If you do not have administrative
access to this machine, you may wish to choose a different installation
directory, preferably one that is listed in your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.

For information on other options, you may wish to consult the
documentation at:

  https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html

Please make the appropriate changes for your system and try again.
